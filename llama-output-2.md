You are a domain expert. Please extract all domain concepts related to this system. Do not attempt to model the system itself.

# AI
Here are some domain concepts related to the autonomous driving system:
1. Vehicle control: The system shall be able to control the vehicle's speed, steering, and braking.
2. Obstacle detection: The system shall be able to detect obstacles, such as other vehicles, pedestrians, and road debris.
3. Trajectory planning: The system shall be able to plan a safe and efficient trajectory for the vehicle to follow.
4. Sensor fusion: The system shall fuse data from multiple sensors, such as cameras, lidar, and radar, to obtain a comprehensive view of the environment.
5. Object detection: The system shall be able to detect and classify objects in the environment, such as pedestrians, vehicles, and road signs.
6. Motion forecasting: The system shall be able to predict the motion of objects in the environment, such as the trajectory of a pedestrian or another vehicle.
7. Route planning: The system shall be able to plan a route to a destination, taking into account road conditions, traffic, and other factors.
8. Driver assistance: The system shall be able to provide assistance to the driver, such as alerts and recommendations, to help them navigate the road safely.
9. Safety monitoring: The system shall be able to monitor the vehicle's safety, such as detecting potential collisions or other hazards.
10. System failures: The system shall be able to detect and respond to system failures, such as sensor failures or software errors.
11. Redundancy: The system shall have redundant components and functions to ensure that it can continue to operate even if one or more components fail.
12. Sensor calibration: The system shall be able to calibrate sensors to ensure that they provide accurate data.
13. Environment perception: The system shall be able to perceive and understand the environment, including road conditions, weather, and traffic patterns.
14. Decision-making: The system shall be able to make decisions in real-time, such as determining the optimal trajectory or avoiding obstacles.
15. Motion control: The system shall be able to control the vehicle's motion, such as steering, accelerating, and braking.
16. Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS): The system shall be able to provide advanced driver assistance functions, such as lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and automatic emergency braking.
17. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication: The system shall be able to communicate with other vehicles, infrastructure, and devices to obtain real-time information and enhance safety and efficiency.
18. Cybersecurity: The system shall be designed with cybersecurity in mind to protect against unauthorized access and ensure the safety and privacy of the occupants.
19. Human-machine interface (HMI): The system shall have an intuitive HMI that allows the driver to interact with the system and receive information and feedback.
20. Vehicle integration: The system shall be integrated with the vehicle's systems and subsystems, such as the engine, transmission, and brakes.
These are some of the domain concepts related to the autonomous driving system. The system is a complex integration of various technologies, software, and hardware, and it requires a deep understanding of the domain to design and implement it successfully.

10. Cybersecurity -- HumanMachineInterface
11. VehicleIntegration -- MotionControl

These are the relations between the domain concepts listed above. Each relation represents a connection between two concepts, and they are listed in a simplified format, with each concept represented by a single word or phrase. The relations can be used to create a graph or diagram that illustrates the relationships between the concepts, which can help in understanding the domain and identifying potential relationships that may not be immediately apparent.
