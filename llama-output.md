For these requirements, please extract the domain concepts of the system

# AI
Sure, here are some domain concepts that can be extracted from the requirements:
1. Vehicle Control: The system must be able to control the vehicle's speed, steering, and braking.
2. Sensor Data: The system must use sensor data from various sources, such as cameras, lidar, and radar, to detect obstacles and determine the vehicle's surroundings.
3. Object Detection: The system must be able to detect objects in the vehicle's surroundings, including pedestrians, other vehicles, and road signs.
4. Motion Planning: The system must be able to plan the vehicle's motion to avoid collisions with obstacles and other vehicles.
5. Trajectory Planning: The system must be able to define a trajectory for the vehicle to follow, taking into account the vehicle's dynamics and the road's shape.
6. Lane Detection: The system must be able to detect the vehicle's position on the road and identify the lane markings.
7. Road Boundary Detection: The system must be able to detect the road boundaries and identify potential hazards.
8. Speed Profile: The system must be able to calculate a speed profile for the vehicle to follow, taking into account the road's shape and any obstacles.
9. Steering Commands: The system must be able to generate steering commands to guide the vehicle along the planned trajectory.
10. Brake Actuators: The system must be able to control the brake actuators to perform braking maneuvers.
11. Motor Control: The system must be able to control the vehicle's motor to perform acceleration and braking maneuvers.
12. Redundant Braking System: The system must have a redundant braking system to mitigate failures of the brake actuators.
13. Safety Checks: The system must perform safety checks to ensure that the vehicle's movements are safe and predictable.
14. Driver Notification: The system must notify the driver in case of any failures or anomalies.
15. Way Points: The system must be able to define a set of way points that the vehicle must follow.
16. Trajectory Updates: The system must be able to update the trajectory whenever the way points change or the vehicle has left the trajectory.
17. Vehicle Status: The system must be able to monitor the vehicle's status, including its speed, steering, and braking.
18. Environmental Factors: The system must be able to take into account environmental factors, such as weather and road conditions.
19. Sensor Fusion: The system must be able to fuse data from multiple sensors to obtain a more accurate picture of the vehicle's surroundings.
20. Controller Failures: The system must be able to mitigate controller failures and perform fail-safe actions to ensure the vehicle's safety.
These domain concepts are the building blocks of the system's functionality and must be carefully considered during the design and development process.
